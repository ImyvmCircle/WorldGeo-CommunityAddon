# README

## Introduction

This Project is designed to constitute a comprehensive framework for player community in Minecraft servers. It is built on the IMYVMWorldGeo as an extension, which provides mechanics centered around **Region**, performing a Minecraft geography element, and is intend to offer an administration simulation system granting players the ability to self-govern their in-game regions in the form of a player community.

## Features

### Community

A community is a player organization linked to a valid and exclusive region in the IMYVMWorldGeo.

#### Creation

A community can be initialized spontaneously by any player trying to inaugurate one,
as long as a valid region is delineated by the same person, and the subsequent criteria are satisfied:

- they are not yet members of any other community with the same type(elaborated below);
- they have enough in-game currency to pay for the community creation fee with the specified type;

Criteria are verified by executing the creation through command or box-interface, and then the community is created with a pending status, awaiting certification. Once certified, the community is a sovereign entity that can direct its internal affairs, as well as establish foreign relations with other communities online.


## Acknowledgements

Were it not for the support of IMYVM fellows and players, this project would not have been possible.
